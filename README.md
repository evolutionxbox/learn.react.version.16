# Learn React version 16

#### First Assignment Instructions

Follow the instructions explained in the problem video and try to implement a solution on your own. Compare it with my solution (video + downloadable files)Â thereafter.

The instructions are:

1.   Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
1.   UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
1.   Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
1.   Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
1.   Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
1.   Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
1.   Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
1.   Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
1.   Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
1.   Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
